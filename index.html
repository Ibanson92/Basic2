                </section>  Jay Redd The Ox was originally born in England to loyal Ghanaian parents. He spent a short time of his childhood in both countries but spent most of his life growing up in America. Redd Ox has always liked and been inspired by gangster rap groups such as The Ruff Rydaz, The Wu-Tang Clan, The Hot Boys, and G-Unit. His favourite music artists throughout his life have been DMX and Bob Marley.

As a child, Redd Ox was passionate about making music and started rapping at the age of 11. </p> <p> During his sophomore year of high school, Ox decided to take a break from music. He took this time to start a career in athletics in hopes to help ensure his place in higher education. His sacrifice of music allowed him to channel all of that explosive energy into sports. Ox was a favoured and multitalented student athlete who participated in his school's football, outdoor track, and wrestling programs.

Upon the completion of high school, Redd Ox received a full-ride athletic scholarship to Bucknell University in Lancaster, PA. The parameters of being a part of a NCAA Division 1 team forced ReddOx to decide between two completely different paths of success. Ultimately, Ox decided to leave that University to recommit to his rap career at The Art Institute of Washington. Unfortunately the famed art school was not the best fit and did not meet the sought after expectations. JayRedd refused to give up on his undergraduate education so he quickly enrolled and was accepted to the illustrious Howard University. In June 2017, ReddOx  graduated from The Cathy Hughes School of Communications with a degree in Communication, Culture, and Media Studies.
