      </section> Hello, I’m Ian Banson. I’m a junior front-end developer with a specialty in Html, CSS, Javascript, and React.
      I was born in London, England and moved to Maryland at the age of 7. I was always into visual art such as drawing and
      painting but was never quite good at it. I participated in arts such as music and poetry but once I entered high school
      I stepped aside from the arts to participate in sports such as football, wrestling, and track. I went on to be captain
      of the varsity wrestling team both my junior and senior year and was captain of the football team my senior year. I
      received a full football scholarship to Bucknell University but after being there for a year I transfered to Howard
      University , later on graduating with a degree in Communication and Culture.<br> While at Howard I was introduced to Html
      and CSS in a web design class I took as an elective. This class turned out to be one of my favorite classes I took
      not just at Howard but in my life. Just the idea of creating gets me excited so when I was able to create websites
      from code I was astonished. After Howard I enrolled into The George Washington University Full Stack Bootcamp learning
      how to fully develop websites.
